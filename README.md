# Image-Analysis-and-Clustering

Welcome to an exciting project where we bring images to life through
data analysis and clustering! In this journey, we’ll take a vibrant image
of a rainbow, transform it into a dataset full of colorful pixel
information, and explore the beauty of data by grouping these pixels
into clusters. Whether it’s using scikit-learn’s trusty KMeans or diving
into custom clustering magic with PyTorch, each task is a step deeper
into the art and science of image processing. Let’s paint a picture with
pixels, break it down into data, and watch the patterns unfold!
